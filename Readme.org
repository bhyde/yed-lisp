[[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html][yEd] is a nice free editor for drawing flow charts and other
diagrams.  For example this very simple drawing.

yEd saves, usually, it's drawing in graphML format.  Which provides
us with a nice chance to chew on the drawing for other purposes.  For
example we might convert flow charts into programs, or whatever.

The code here loads the graphML, creating a reasonably clean
sexpr and then extracts the topology from that.

The shell script topology.sh, which uses cl-launch uses that code to
display all the edges.  But it doesn't work for me yet.

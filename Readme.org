[[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html][yEd]] is a nice free editor for drawing flow charts and other
diagrams.  For example this very simple drawing.

[[file:abc.png]]

yEd saves, usually, it's drawing in graphML format ([[file:./abc.graphml][for example]]).  Which provides
us with a nice chance to chew on the drawing for other purposes.  For
example we might convert charts into programs, rdf, ontologies, etc.

Inspired by [[https://github.com/guitarvydas][Paul Tarvydas]]' short lightning talk at ILC 2004 I thought
it would be fun to write some code that eats the graphml files.

The code here loads the graphML, creating a reasonably clean
sexpr; that looks something like this:

#+begin_src lisp
(:graphml ((:schemalocation . 1.1))
 (:key ((:yfiles.type "resources") (:id . 0) (:for . :graphml)))
 ...
 (:graph ((:id "G") (:edgedefault "directed")) (:data ((:key . 7)))

  (:node ((:id . 0)) (:data ((:key . 5)))
   (:data ((:key . 6))
    (:shapenode nil
     (:geometry ((:y . 36.0) ...))
     (:fill (...))
     (:borderstyle (...))
     (:nodelabel
      ((:y . 5.93359375) (:x . 28.8125) (:width . 37.375) ...)
      "Alpha"
      (:labelmodel ...)
      (:modelparameter ...)) ...)))

  ...

  (:edge ((:target . 2) (:source . 0) (:id . 0)) (:data ((:key . 9)))
   (:data ((:key . 10))
    (:splineedge nil 
     (:path ((:ty . 0.0) ...))
     (:linestyle (...))
     (:arrows (...)))))
   ...
#+end_src

There is bit of code to extract the toplogy (nodes and edges) from
sexpressions like that.

The shell script topology.sh, which uses cl-launch all the edges.
But, I'm currently having problems getting cl-launch to work.  So
you can just eval that file and then run something like this:

#+begin_src shell
> (cl-user::main '("/Users/luser/w/yd-lisp/abc.graphml"))
Alpha -> Beta
Beta -> Cancel
Beta -> Beta
Beta -> Beta
#+end_src

Which illustrates that there are two extra edges in the abc.graphml that
doesn't appear in the drawing.  Mysteries abound.
